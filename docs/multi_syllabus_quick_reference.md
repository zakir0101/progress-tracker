## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `students` - Student information
- `syllabuses` - Available syllabuses
- `syllabus_variants` - Syllabus variants (Core/Extended)
- `syllabus_topics` - Individual topics
- `student_syllabus_assignments` - Student-syllabus relationships
- `student_progress` - Per-syllabus progress tracking
- `topic_updates` - Progress change logs

### Key Relationships
- Students can be assigned to multiple syllabuses
- Progress tracked independently per syllabus
- Each syllabus has variants and topics
- Topics have weights for progress calculation

## API Quick Reference

### Student Endpoints
```
POST /update-topic          # Update topic progress
GET  /student-progress      # Get progress for syllabus
GET  /student-syllabuses    # Get assigned syllabuses
```

### Teacher Endpoints
```
GET  /all-progress          # All student progress
GET  /student-list          # All students
GET  /all-syllabuses        # Available syllabuses
GET  /syllabus/<id>         # Syllabus structure
POST /assign-syllabus       # Assign syllabus to student
```

### System Endpoints
```
GET  /initialize            # Initialize database
GET  /syllabus              # Backward compatibility
GET  /test                  # Health check
```

## Frontend Applications

### Student Tracker React App (`student-tracker-react/`)
- **React 18**: Modern React application with Vite build system
- **Syllabus Selector**: Dropdown to switch between assigned syllabuses
- **Dynamic Content**: Syllabus content loads based on selection
- **Progress Tracking**: Per-syllabus progress calculation
- **Contact Syllabus**: Hidden when other syllabuses are assigned
- **Development**: `npm run dev` (port 5173)
- **Production**: `npm run build` (outputs to `student_tracker/`)

### Teacher Dashboard React App (`teacher-dashboard-react/`)
- **React 18**: React application with Zustand state management
- **Syllabus Assignment**: Form to assign syllabuses to students
- **Syllabus Filtering**: Filter student view by syllabus
- **Multi-Syllabus Stats**: Statistics across all syllabuses
- **Enhanced Export**: CSV includes syllabus information
- **Charts**: Chart.js integration for data visualization
- **Development**: `npm run dev` (port 5174)
- **Production**: `npm run build` (outputs to `teacher_dashboard/`)

## Configuration

### Syllabus Files
- Location: `syllabuses/` directory
- Format: JSON files with syllabus structure
- Naming: `<syllabus_id>.json` (e.g., `0580.json`)

### Contact Syllabus
- Automatically created for new students
- Contains 2 topics: "Contact Administrator" and "Enroll in Course"
- Hidden when student has other syllabuses assigned

## Migration Notes

### From Single Syllabus
- Existing students automatically assigned to contact syllabus + 0580
- Progress data migrated to new per-syllabus structure
- Backward compatibility maintained for `/syllabus` endpoint

### Adding New Syllabuses
1. Add syllabus JSON file to `syllabuses/` directory
2. Restart application to auto-populate database
3. Assign to students via teacher dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**React Apps Not Loading**
- Verify React applications were built: `npm run build`
- Check if built files exist in `student_tracker/` and `teacher_dashboard/`
- Ensure Flask server is running and serving React apps
- Check browser console for React errors

**Student can't see syllabuses**
- Check if student has syllabuses assigned
- Verify contact syllabus is not being hidden
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify React app is properly configured

**Progress not updating**
- Verify syllabus_id is being sent in requests
- Check database connection
- Verify topic IDs exist in syllabus
- Check React component state management

**Teacher can't assign syllabus**
- Verify student email exists
- Check if syllabus is already assigned
- Verify API endpoint is accessible
- Check React state management in teacher dashboard

### Debug Tips
- Check browser developer console for errors
- Verify API responses in Network tab
- Test with fresh database if needed
- Check Flask application logs

## Performance Notes

- Database optimized for multi-syllabus queries
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Progress calculation uses weighted topics
- Efficient syllabus structure loading

## Security Features

- Google OAuth authentication
- Per-user rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection
- Session timeout (1 hour)

## Support

For technical support:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API configuration
3. Test with different browsers
4. Check Flask application logs
5. Verify database initialization
