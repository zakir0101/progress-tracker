Calculators

The syllabus assumes that candidates will be in possession of a scientific calculator for both papers.

Candidates must show all necessary working; no marks will be given to unsupported answers from a calculator.

Non-exact numerical answers will be required to be given correct to three significant figures, or one decimal place in the case of angles in degrees, unless a different level of accuracy is specified in the question.
